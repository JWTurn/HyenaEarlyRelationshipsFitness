## Formulas

$$ HWI = \frac{x}{x + Y_{ab} + \frac{1}{2}(Y_{a} * Y_{b})} $$

$$ TWI = \frac{x}{x + 2Y_{ab} +Y_{a} * Y_{b}}$$

## Variables

$x$ = number of instances where individuals a and b were observed, associating

$Yab$ = number of instances where individuals a and b were observed, not associating

$Ya$ = number of instances where individual a was observed, and individual b was not observed

$Yb$ = number of instances where individual b was observed, and individual a was not observed

## Assumptions

In the case of GPS data with regular fix rates, all individuals are (usually) located at each "observation" and therefore, $Ya$ and $Yb$ are 0 or nearly 0. 

In the case of focal observations, if we assume a single observer can only observe one group at a time, and all groups are temporally distinct, then $Yab$ is 0. If groups are not temporally distinct (e.g.: more than one observer observing different groups at the same time), then the temporal component must provided to calculate $Ya$, $Yb$ and $Yab$.
