## Abstract

1.  How social development in early life affects fitness remains poorly
    understood.
2.  Though there is growing evidence that early-life relationships can
    affect fitness, little research has investigated how social
    positions develop or whether there are particularly important
    periods for social position development in an animal’s life history.
    In long-lived species in particular, understanding the lasting
    consequences of early-life social environments requires detailed,
    long-term datasets.
3.  Here we used a 25-year dataset to test whether social positions held
    during early development predicted adult fitness. Specifically, we
    quantified social position using three social network metrics:
    degree, strength, and betweenness. We determined the social position
    of each individual in three types of networks during each of three
    stages of ontogeny to test whether they predict annual reproductive
    success (ARS) or longevity among adult female spotted hyenas
    (Crocuta crocuta).
4.  The social positions occupied by juvenile hyenas did predict their
    fitness, but the effects of social position on fitness measures
    differed between stages of early development. Network metrics when
    individuals were young adults better predicted ARS, but network
    metrics for younger animals, particularly when youngsters were
    confined to the communal den, better predicted longevity than did
    metrics assessed during other stages of development.
5.  Our study shows how multiple types of social bonds formed during
    multiple stages of social development predict lifetime fitness
    outcomes. We suggest that social bonds formed during specific phases
    of development may be more important than others when considering
    fitness outcomes.
